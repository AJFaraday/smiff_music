'{name}' is a drum, you could try these messages to change {name}:
* play {name} on step 1
* play {name} on steps 1, 2 and 3
* play {name} on steps 9 to 13
* play {name} on steps 1 to 16 skipping 3
* do not play {name} on step 1
* do not play {name} on steps 1, 2 and 3
* do not play {name} on steps 9 to 13
* do not play {name} on steps 1 to 16 skipping 3
* mute {name}
* unmute {name}
* clear {name}

Or this one to see the {name} pattern:
* show {name}
