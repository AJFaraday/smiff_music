# Using The Terminal

_Note: if you use a unix or linux terminal, stop reading now. You know this already._

The main way to interact with SMIFF is via the terminal. This is the black area with a text field beneath it. 

Click on the text field to focus on the terminal, then you can type messages (as described on the 'messages' page), and either press enter or click 'Send' to send the message.

Once you have sent one message you can press up and down to scroll through your previous messages which you can run again.

Once you have scrolled back to a previous message you can modify it before re-running it.

This behaviour is useful for building patterns, you can re-use the format of a message, but change the details.

For example:

<pre>
> play kick on steps 1, 5, 9 and 13
(press enter)
(press up)
(change the message to:)
> play snare on steps 5 and 13
(press enter)
(press up)
(change message to)
> play tom1 on step 3
(enter, up, change)
> play tom2 on step 6
(enter, up, change)
> play tom3 on step 8
</pre>
