## What does SMIFF do?

SMIFF Music consists of two main components:

* the player
* the terminal

The player holds patterns and sounds for each instrument, and when you click play (situated in the header) it plays through the sequence, looping back to the begining when it reaches the end. 

At the end of each pattern, it checks with the database to see if someone else has changed the pattern. If it has then it will modify the pattern in the player. 

You can see the patterns currently being played in the Overview tab on SMIFFs home page.

The terminal can be found in the Terminal tab on SMIFFs home page.

You can use the terminal to change the pattern simply by typing in messages (in the white text field, below the large black area) and pressing enter.
