## What is SMIFF?

SMIFF Music is a web application by Andrew Faraday (@MarmiteJunction), exploring the use of the internet as a tool for creating music collaboratively.

SMIFF Music stands for Social Media Interface for Music.

In the current version (version zero), SMIFF is just a drum machine, and does not have a Social Media Interface. Version zero is a proof of concept, demonstrating that music can be made within a web browser and modifed via a collection of text messages. It also demonstrates that more than one person can modify the same pattern, and everyone listening will hear the resultant changes.

This means that SMIFF is a tool for making electronic music as a social activity, but anonymously. So the resulting sound is created by and, in part, owned by everyone who uses the application.
