# Help!

There is some help available for SMIFF music. To get some help on using in-line help
you can just type

<pre>
> help
</pre>

You can get help about a specific area by typing any of these:

<pre>
> help synth
> help me with the drums
> I can't use the player, help!
</pre>

As long as it contains the word 'help' and something that SMIFF recognises, it will try to help you.
