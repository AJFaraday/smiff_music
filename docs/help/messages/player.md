## Player

There are a number of messages to modify the speed of the player.

* show speed
* set speed to 120 bpm
* speed up
* speed down

This will tell you what speed, in beats per minute (BPM), the sequence is being played at.

```
> show speed
Sequence is being played at 180 bpm
```

### set speed to X

Example:

```
> set speed to 140 bpm
```

This will set playback to a specific speed in beats per minutes (BPM).

*Note:* The outer limits of speeds available will be set by SMIFF, but there will be a lot of freedom within this range.

### speed up

Example:

```
> speed up
```

This will increase the speed of playback by 5bpm

### speed down

Example:

```
> speed down
```

This will decrease the speed of playback by 5bpm

This can also be written as:

```
> slow down
```
