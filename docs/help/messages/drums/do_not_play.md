### do not play

Examples:

<pre>
> do not play kick on beat 5
> do not play snare on beats 1 to 8
> do not play hihat on beats 1 to 16 skipping 1
> do not play hihat on steps 1, 3 and 5
</pre>

This works in exactly the same way as play, except that the sequence will be changed so that the notes specified will not be played on the steps identified.
