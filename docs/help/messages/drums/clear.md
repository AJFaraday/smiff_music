### clear

Example:

<pre>
> clear kick
</pre>

This will clear a drum pattern. Leaving it empty.

You can also clear more than one pattern:

<pre>
clear kick and snare
clear kick, snare and hihat
</pre>

You can also clear all drums with this message:

<pre>
clear all drums
</pre>


Not to be confused with

<pre>
clear all
</pre>

Which will clear all patterns, not just the drums.
