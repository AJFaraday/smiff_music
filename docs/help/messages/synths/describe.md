This will display a short description of the synthesizer, what type of synthesis it uses and which parameters you can change.

For instance:

<pre>
> describe fm
'fm' is a frequency modulation ('FM') synthesizer. FM synthesisers produce two sound waves, one is the tone you hear (called the 'carrier') and the other (called the 'modulator') changes the frequency of the carrier. 
Parameters:
* volume - How loudly the synth sounds.
* fm_depth - How much the modulator changes the frequency of the carrier.
* fm_frequency - The frequency of the modulator, as a proportion of the pitch.
* fm_waveshape - The wave shape of the modulator.
