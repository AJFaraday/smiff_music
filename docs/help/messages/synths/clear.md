### clear

Example:

<pre>
> clear sine
</pre>

This will clear a sine pattern. Leaving it empty.

You can also clear more than one pattern:

<pre>
clear sine and square
</pre>

You can also clear all synths with this message:

<pre>
clear all synths
</pre>

Not to be confused with

<pre>
clear all
</pre>

Which will clear all patterns, not just the synths.
