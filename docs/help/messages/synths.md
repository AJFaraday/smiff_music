# Synths

_Note:_ this is speculative, no messages are set just yet.

Synth is short for synthesizer, a device which produces a sound from it's component parts.

In the context of SMIFF a synthesizer will play a note at a specific pitch, which starts at a given step and runs for a given amount of time.

SMIFF's synthesizers are monophonic, they will only play one note at any given time.

There are four things we neet to know to add a note to a synth in SMIFF:

* the name of the synth (e.g.: sine)
* pitch - made up of the note name and octave (e.g.: A 4)
* starting step (e.g.: 5)
* length (e.g.: 4)
