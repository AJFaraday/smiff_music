SMIFF Music - Social Media Interface For Music
----------------------------------------------

The (end-game) idea is simple, people send a tweet then my app makes music. Only the music is written, modified and interacted with by many people over the web. Hopefully producing an unending and infinitely modifiable, constantly developing and organic piece of music where all are involved.

That's the idea, anyway.

THIS IS JUST A CONCEPT! I will document more when more exists.


Components:

* Ruby on Rails app - serves data on the current content of the music, and the JS player. 
* Web-audio player - using the web audio api, this will produce the sound spontaneously on the client computer.
* Twitter search - This will look for tweets addressed to the account and makes the recommended changes to the sound. 
* Twitter account - This will be the mark of tweets being sent to SMIFF, and may return some patterns on request.
